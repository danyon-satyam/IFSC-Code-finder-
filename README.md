### **IFSC Code Finder Project - 4th Semester (B.Tech CSEDS)**  
**Academic Year**: 2022-23  
**Institution**: GIET University

**Project Overview**:  
The IFSC (Indian Financial System Code) Code Finder is a web-based application developed to provide users with a simple and efficient way to search and retrieve the IFSC codes of banks across India. IFSC codes are essential for facilitating electronic payments like NEFT, RTGS, and IMPS. This application enables users to quickly access the correct IFSC codes by entering bank and branch details or browsing through available bank information.

The project aims to offer a user-friendly interface and a database that ensures accurate and up-to-date IFSC codes for all branches of participating banks. The application improves the process of finding IFSC codes, helping individuals and businesses ensure accurate transaction details while reducing the risk of errors.

**Key Features**:  
- **IFSC Code Search**: Users can search for IFSC codes by providing bank name, state, district, and branch information.
- **Database of Banks and Branches**: The system maintains a comprehensive database of Indian banks and their respective branches, ensuring quick access to valid IFSC codes.
- **Error Handling**: In case of incorrect or incomplete inputs, the system provides feedback and suggestions for a more accurate search.
- **Responsive Design**: The user interface is designed to be mobile-friendly, allowing users to access the system from a range of devices.

**Technology Stack**:  
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Backend**: PHP  
- **Database**: MySQL  
- **Tools/Environment**: XAMPP, Apache Server  

**My Role and Contributions**:  
As a key contributor to the development of this project, I was responsible for several aspects of both the frontend and backend of the system:
- **Frontend Development**: Designed a simple and intuitive user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure ease of use for all types of users.
- **Backend Development**: Developed the backend logic using PHP, ensuring efficient query handling and accurate retrieval of IFSC codes from the MySQL database.
- **Database Design and Management**: Structured and maintained the MySQL database to store detailed information about banks and their branches, ensuring quick search capabilities.
- **API Integration**: Implemented APIs to update and verify IFSC code data, keeping the information current and reliable.
- **Testing and Debugging**: Carried out extensive testing of the application to resolve bugs and ensure that the application delivers accurate results under all scenarios.
- **Documentation**: Contributed to the technical documentation, outlining the system architecture, codebase, and functionality for future reference and maintenance.

This project helped me enhance my web development skills, particularly in PHP and MySQL database management. It also provided valuable experience in working with APIs and developing real-world applications that prioritize both functionality and user experience.
